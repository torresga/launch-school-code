# is this design, with Human and Computer sub-classes, better? Why, or why not?
# Humans and computers are similar, but the way they make decisions is different. It makes more sense from an OOP perspective for Human and Computer to have a is-a relationship with Player, but to be neighboring classes.
# what is the primary improvement of this new design?
# We can add more functionality to Human and Computer without worrying about the other player type.
# what is the primary drawback of this new design?
# Can Human and Computer interact with each other if we ended up putting the game logic inside of Human and Computer classes?

# Still a lot of logic that can be refactored better - loops, display_winner
