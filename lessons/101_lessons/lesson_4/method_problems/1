The return value of the select method is [1, 2, 3].

Select evaluates the block for each element in the collection and returns whether the value of the last expression in the block is truthy.

Since all values in Ruby are 'truthy' except for false and nil, this would mean that all of the elements in the array [1, 2, 3] would be returned because 'hi', the last expression of the block, evaluates to true.
