greetings will be {a: 'hi there'}

This is because the line
informal_greeting = greetings[:a]
assigns a reference to the object in the value greetings[:a]
then informal_greeting << ' there'
modifies the object that both greetings[:a] and informal_greeting refer to, because the << method mutates its' caller.
