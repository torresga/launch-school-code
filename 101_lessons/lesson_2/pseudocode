1. Method that returns sum of two integers.

Input: two integers
Output: sum of integers

Casual Pseudocode

Given two integers.

Create a variable to hold the sum value.

Assign the addition of integer1 and integer2 to the sum variable.

Return Sum.

Formal Pseudocode

START
SET sum = 0
sum = integer1 + integer2
PRINT sum
END

2. A method that takes an array of strings and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together.

Input: array of strings
Output: string of concatenated strings

Given a collection of strings.

Create a variable for resulting string.

Iterate over collection of strings.
For each element of collection
  Append current string to resulting string

Return resulting string

Formal Pseudocode

Given a collection of strings.

START
SET result = ""
SET space = 1
WHILE space < length of collection
  current_element = current collection element
  append current_element to result
  space = space + 1

PRINT result
END

3. A method that takes an array of integers and returns a new array with every other element.

Input: Array of integers
Output: New array with every other element

Given a collection of integers.

Create a new variable for resulting collection.

Iterate over collection of integers
For each element of collection
  if element's space is odd
   skip element
  else add element to new collection

Return new collection

Formal Pseudocode

Given a collection of integers.
SET new_numbers = []
SET iterator = 1
WHILE iterator < length of old collection
  current_number = current collection element
  IF iterator is odd
    skip
  ELSE
    append current_number to new_numbers
  iterator = iterator + 1

PRINT new_numbers
END
