munsters = {
  "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
  "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
}

loop through munsters hash,
for each key value pair,
  if munster age value is > 0 and <= 17,
    munster's age group is kid
  else if munster age value is >= 18 and <= 64
    munster's age group is adult
  else if munster age value is >= 65
    munster's age group is senior

1. Use loop and if statements

counter = 0
names = munsters.keys

loop do
  current_person = names[counter]
  current_info = munsters[current_person]
  current_age = current_info["age"]

  if current_age > 0 && current_age <= 17
    current_info["age_group"] = "kid"
  elsif current_age >= 18 && current_age <= 64
    current_info["age_group"] = "adult"
  elsif current_age >= 65
    current_info["age_group"] = "senior"
  end

  counter += 1
  break if counter == names.size
end

2. use #each_with_object

munsters.each_with_object({}) do |(key, value), hash|
  current_age = value["age"]
  age_group = case
    when current_age > 0 && current_age <= 17
      "kid"
    when current_age >= 18 && current_age <= 64
      "adult"
    when current_age >= 65
      "senior"
    end

  hash[key] = value
  value["age_group"] = age_group
end

This both returns a new object but modifies the existing munsters object... but why?
