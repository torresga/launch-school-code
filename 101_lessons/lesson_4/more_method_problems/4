ages = { "Herman" => 32, "Lily" => 30, "Grandpa" => 5843, "Eddie" => 10, "Marilyn" => 22, "Spot" => 237 }

1. Using loop
counter = 0
people = ages.keys
minimum_age = ages[people.first]

loop do
  current_person = people[counter]
  current_age = ages[current_person]
  minimum_age = current_age if current_age < minimum_age
  counter += 1
  break if counter == people.size
end
minimum_age => 10

2. Using a loop to get a hash instead of just a number
counter = 0
people = ages.keys
minimum_age = {}
minimum_age[people.first] = ages[people.first]

loop do
  current_person = people[counter]
  current_age = ages[current_person]

  if current_age < minimum_age.values.first
    minimum_age = {}
    minimum_age[current_person] = current_age
  end

  counter += 1
  break if counter == people.size
end
minimum_age => {"Eddie" => 10}

3. Using #values and #sort and #select
minimum_age = ages.values.sort.first
ages.select {|_, v| v == minimum_age}
