1. Lines 1 and 2 need semi-colons at the end of each statement.

Line 5's left bracket { should be on line 4.

ice_cream_taste and ice_cream_density should use camelCase.

On line 4, there should be a space between while keyword and expression.

Sould be spaces on line 10 between string literal and concatenation operator (+).

Indent with two spaces.

let iceCreamTaste = 'chocolate';
let iceCreamDensity = 10;

while (iceCreamDensity > 0) {
  console.log('Drip...');
  iceCreamDensity -= 1;
}

console.log('The ' + iceCreamTaste + ' ice cream melted.');

2.
7 data types:
string
Number
bigint
Boolean
null
undefined
symbol

3. On the Data Structures page, look at number type. There is a constant Number.MAX_VALUE

4. 20 + 9 / 10 = 20.9
This is because each operator has a precedence. Exponentation has the highest precedence of the arithmetic operators, then is multiplication, division, and remainder, and then addition and subtraction.

5. Date.now() returns the number of milliseconds elapsed since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.

6. getYear() is deprecated. It returns only the last two/three digits of the year (current year - 1900). getFullYear() returns the full year.

7. Array.prototype.join() expects zero or one arguments. If join is called with zero arguments, a string is returned with ',' between each element in the array. If more than one argument is called with join(), the extra arguments are ignored.

8. We can use the addition operator: 'a' + 'b'. Also we can use String.prototype.concat()

9. There aren't enough brackets on line 4. it should be instead:
if ((currentSpeed > speedLimit) && ((currentSpeed - speedLimit) > 5))

10. TypeError says: operation could not be performed typically when a value is not of the expected type. Array.length is not a function, it is a property.
