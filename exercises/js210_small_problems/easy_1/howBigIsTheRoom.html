    // How Big is the Room
    // Build a program that asks a user for the length and width of a room in meters, and then logs to the console the area of the room in both square meters and square feet.
    //
    // Note: 1 square meter == 10.7639 square feet
    //
    // Do not worry about validating the input at this time. Use the prompt() function to collect user input.

    // Input: two integers that represent the length and the width of a room in meters
    // Output: The area of the room in square meters and square feet.

    // Rules
    // - don't worry about validating input
    // - use prompt to collect input
    //
    // What is area? Length * width
    // Length * width gives us area in square meters, area * 10.7639 will give us area in square feet.
    //
    // Input is a string, so we will have to use Number() or parseInt to convert to an integer.

    // Algorithm
    // Ask for the length of a room in meters
    // Ask for the widgh of a room in meters
    // Ask for the input type
    // Convert length from a string to a number
    // Convert width from a string to a number
    // Calculate area in meters: length * width
    // Calculate area in square feet: area * 10.7639
    // Output area in meters
    // Output area in square feet

    var lengthOfRoom;
    var widthOfRoom;
    var inputType;
    var area;
    var METER_TO_SQUARE_FEET = 10.7639;

    lengthOfRoom = parseInt(prompt('Enter the length of the room in meters:'), 10);
    widthOfRoom = parseInt(prompt('Enter the width of the room in meters:'), 10);
    inputType = prompt('Is this in square meters (m) or square feet (f)?');

    if (inputType === 'm') {
      area = lengthOfRoom * widthOfRoom;
      console.log(`The area of the room is ${area.toFixed(2)} square meters.`);
    } else if (inputType === 'f') {
      area = (lengthOfRoom * widthOfRoom) * METER_TO_SQUARE_FEET;
      console.log(`The area of the room is ${area.toFixed(2)} square feet.`);
    } else {
      console.log('I don\'t know that type.');
    }

    // Further Exploration
    // Modify the program so that it asks the user for the input type (meters or feet). Compute for the area accordingly, and log it and its conversion in parentheses.
