  // Madlibs
  // Madlibs is a simple game where you create a story template with "blanks" for words. You, or another player, then construct a list of words and place them into the story, creating an often silly or funny story as a result.

  // Create a simple madlib program that prompts for a noun, a verb, an adverb, and an adjective, and injects them into a story that you create.
  //
  // Algorithm
  // Prompt user for a noun
  // Prompt user for a verb
  // Prompt user for an adjective
  // Prompt user for an adverb
  // Output: Do you verb your adjective noun adverb? That's hilarious!

  // Example:

  // Enter a noun: dog
  // Enter a verb: walk
  // Enter an adjective: blue
  // Enter an adverb: quickly

  var noun = prompt('Enter a noun: ');
  var verb = prompt('Enter a verb: ');
  var adjective = prompt('Enter an adjective: ');
  var adverb = prompt('Enter an adverb: ');

  console.log(`Do you ${verb} your ${adjective} ${noun} ${adverb}? That's hilarious!`);
