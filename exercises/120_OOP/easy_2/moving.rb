# You have the following classes.

module Walkable

    "#{name} #{gait} forward"
  end

class Person

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name

    "strolls"
  end
end

class Cat
  include Walkable
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "saunters"

class Cheetah
  include Walkable
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name

  def gait
    "runs"

# You need to modify the code so that this works:

mike = Person.new("Mike")
p mike.walk
# => "Mike strolls forward"

kitty = Cat.new("Kitty")
p kitty.walk
# => "Kitty saunters forward"

flash = Cheetah.new("Flash")
p flash.walk
# => "Flash runs forward"

# You are only allowed to write one new method to do this
