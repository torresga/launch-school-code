// Oddities
// The oddities function takes an array as an argument and returns a new array containing every other element from the input array. The values in the returned array are the first (index 0), third, fifth, and so on, elements of the input array. The program below uses the array returned by oddities as part of a comparison. Can you explain the results of these comparisons?
//
// Examples:

function oddities(array) {
  var oddElements = [];
  var i;

  for (i = 0; i < array.length; i += 2) {
    oddElements.push(array[i]);
  }

  return oddElements;
}

console.log(oddities([2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) === [2, 4, 6]);      // false
console.log(oddities(['abc', 'def']) === ['abc']);         // false

// These two tests return false because the array returned by oddities and the array it's being compared to is not the same array object. === compares whether the two elements are the same object (or primitive)
