// Array Copy Part 1
// Read through the code shown below. What does it log to the console at lines 5 and 8?

var myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];
var myOtherArray = myArray; // so here, myOtherArray and myArray refer to the same object

myArray.pop();
console.log(myOtherArray); // [1, 2, 3]

myArray = [1, 2];
console.log(myOtherArray); // [1, 2, 3] because now myOtherArray and myArray refer to two different objects
