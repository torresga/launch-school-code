# Find the Duplicate
# Given an unordered array and the information that exactly one value in the array occurs twice (every other value occurs exactly once), how would you determine which value occurs twice? Write a method that will find and return the duplicate value that is known to be in the array.

# Input: One unordered array
# Output: One integer that occurs twice in the array
# Mental model: Given an array full of unique elements except for one value that occurs twice, determine how to find and return the duplicate value.

# Examples:

# find_dup([1, 5, 3, 1]) == 1
# find_dup([18,  9, 36, 96, 31, 19, 54, 75, 42, 15,
#           38, 25, 97, 92, 46, 69, 91, 59, 53, 27,
#           14, 61, 90, 81,  8, 63, 95, 99, 30, 65,
#           78, 76, 48, 16, 93, 77, 52, 49, 37, 29,
#           89, 10, 84,  1, 47, 68, 12, 33, 86, 60,
#           41, 44, 83, 35, 94, 73, 98,  3, 64, 82,
#           55, 79, 80, 21, 39, 72, 13, 50,  6, 70,
#           85, 87, 51, 17, 66, 20, 28, 26,  2, 22,
#           40, 23, 71, 62, 73, 32, 43, 24,  4, 56,
#           7,  34, 57, 74, 45, 11, 88, 67,  5, 58]) == 73

# Data structure
# Input is array. Internally we can work with array. Output can be integer.

# Algorithm
# Sort array.
# Create duplicate element variable
# Loop through array
#   If current element is equal to next element
#     Add current element to duplicate
# Return duplicate


# Code
def find_dup(arr)
#   sorted_array = arr.sort
#   duplicate = 0

#   sorted_array.each_with_index do |elem, idx|
#     if elem == sorted_array[idx+1]
#       duplicate = elem
#     end
#   end

#   duplicate
    arr.select {|i| arr.count(i) > 1}.uniq.first
end

# Further Exploration
# There are several ways to go about solving this problem. One other way would be to have a separate array that keeps track of which items have been looked at as we iterate through the original array. If we ever add the same item twice to this second array, then we know that we have found a duplicate.

# How did you end up solving this one?
